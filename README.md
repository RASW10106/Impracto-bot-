# Impracto-bot

This is the official hack for the Impractical Hackers MLH Hackathon!

### Inspiration

You know how when you think of discord bots, you think of fun, or helpful, or efficient? Well, we decided to do the opposite of that for impractical hackers! This bot is an extremely inefficient, and impractical hack!

### What it does

This bot tries to make everything as difficult and annoying as possible. *We even slipped a rickroll in there!* Every single command now just wastes you time, making sure to be inefficient an impractical.
